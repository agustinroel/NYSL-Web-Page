                    <p>FIFA rules shall govern NYSL play except as modified herein.</p>
                    <h2>SPORTSMANSHIP</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to practice
                            the
                            ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator,
                            administrator
                            or referee whose behaviour detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action
                            regardless of technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>
                            <h2>DIMENSIONS.</h2>FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within a
                            given
                            maximum and minimum width and lenght. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields
                            used
                            by teams under 12 and older.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2>COMPETITION FIELDS.</h2>Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of
                            100
                            x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations participating in the state competition
                            program
                            that are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the
                            State
                            Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend
                            to
                            the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from
                            leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
                            required to play all their games away.

                                        <li>The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will be made by the
                                            governing body of that team. A team's bench area shall consist of that area

                                            extending twenty yards one (1) way from the halfway line.</li>
                                        <li>The home team has first choice as to where it wishes to locate its bench
                                            area.
                                            Coaches and substitutes are required to remain within their bench area.
